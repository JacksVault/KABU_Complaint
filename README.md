Student Complaints Web App 
This is a web app designed to allow students of Kabarak University to submit complaints about harassment by security guards at the school. The app features a simple user interface with input fields for the student's registration number, school email, and statement of complaint. When a complaint is submitted, it is sent directly to the administration and copied to the Vice Chancellor's office for review.  The app is built using Vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with the Vite development server for rapid development and testing. It is hosted on Firebase for easy deployment and scalability.  Contributions and feedback are welcome. Please report any issues or feature requests in the Issues section of this repo.
