We created this site to provide a safe and anonymous platform for students to report incidents of harassment by security guards. We believe that every student has the right to feel safe and respected on campus, and we are committed to addressing these concerns through proper channels.</p>

We understand that reporting harassment can be a difficult and emotional experience, which is why we have designed this site to be as straightforward and supportive as possible.</p>
